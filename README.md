I decided late that I wanted to add a GUI component and since I was limited to just C#, I had to change my plans so that's why my program may differ from my planning documents. Using Windows Forms and C#, I built a GUI for my code and it is different than the classes I had planned out because the way Windows Forms works is different than a regular console or terminal program. Thank you.

**To Run:**
- Download the zipped file from GitHub.

- Navigate to ...\amal-calendar\amal-calendar\bin\Debug\net6.0-windows\amal-calendar.exe.

- Run the .exe Application file.

**To See Code:**

Open Visual Studio 2022 and select  ...\amal-calendar\amal-calendar.sln and you can see the code files.

There are no build issues but if you restart the application many times and it doesn't build properly,
navigate to your computer's task manager and find any "amal-calendar" processes running and end them.

Then they will build properly and you can use the program.
Also, you can run directly from Visual Studio by pressing the green triangle on the top toolbar.

**Note:**
I recommend using the "Logout" button because you won't run into problems if you use that. This is just a Visual Studio glitch I had where if I had it open somehow, it wouldn't let me run it again within Visual Studio.
