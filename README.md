# Amal - Calendar App 
Requirements to Run: .NET (Microsoft) 7.0+
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download
Visual Basic 2022
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

To Run:
Navigate to ...\amal-calendar\amal-calendar\bin\Debug\net6.0-windows\amal-calendar.exe
Run the .exe Application file for just the application.

To See Code:
Open Visual Studio 2022 and open  ...\amal-calendar\amal-calendar.sln and you can see the code files.
There are no build issues but if you restart the application many times and it doesn't build properly,
navigate to your computer's task manager and find any "amal-calendar" processes running and end them.
Then they will build properly and you can use the program.

I recommend using the "Logout" button because you won't run into problems if you use that. This is just a Visual Studio glitch I had.
